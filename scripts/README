At the moment this makes .png files of every .csv-file in directory. 

Usage: Write into the command line
	$  for i in *.csv;do octave plotscript.m "$i";done

and the files will be generated with all your data in it.

Assumes that the first line is uncommented text and no others contain it.

NOTE: Coded with Octave 3.2.4 (because there isn't newer versions for ubuntu), it may or may not work with other versions.
